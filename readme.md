## Reflection: 

Reflecting on the 'Event Manager' assignment, I found that the challenge of diagnosing and fixing bugs in the code was not only a significant learning curve but also a deeply rewarding process. Each error corrected felt like a significant victory, providing invaluable insights into the system’s inner workings. Managing these issues taught me the importance of persistence and meticulous attention to detail.

In addition to technical skills, I also appreciated the value of using version control with Git and GitHub. These tools proved essential not just for managing changes but for facilitating a structured workflow and ensuring that all my work was well-documented and organized. This aspect of the project was particularly enlightening, as it highlighted the importance of good practices in software development.

Moreover, the project wasn’t just about coding; it was about learning to think systematically and improve continuously. It encouraged a proactive approach to problem-solving and innovation, driving me to explore solutions that were not only effective but also efficient. The hands-on experience has significantly boosted my confidence and has prepared me for more complex projects in the future, also it has been the one of the most assignments that challenged me this much. 


## Setup and Preliminary Steps

1. **Fork the Project Repository**: Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/yourusername/event_manager) to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your account, allowing you to work on the project independently.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer, enabling you to make changes and run the project locally.

3. **Verify the Project Setup**: Follow the steps in the instructor video to set up the project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Docker allows you to package the application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Verify that you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost/docs` and the database using [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) at `http://localhost:5050`.
